# Statistical_analysis-of_data
**Objective: Compare revenue generation between different type of prepaid plans.**

Data: Analyzed 500 users' behavior (calls, SMS, data usage) in 2018 across 5 datasets.

Preprocessing: Cleaned data, calculated monthly usage (calls, messages, GB), and derived revenue per user.

Key Metrics: Monthly averages, variances, and standard deviations for usage patterns by plan.

Visualizations: Created histograms to compare usage distributions between plans.

Hypotheses: Tested if revenue differs between plans and NY-NJ vs. other regions (alpha = 0.05).

Findings:

Ultimate users generated higher average revenue despite lower overage fees.

Surf users frequently exceeded limits, increasing revenue via overage charges.

Stats Tools: Used t-tests to reject null hypotheses for revenue differences.

Insights: Ultimateâ€™s higher base fee outweighed Surfâ€™s overage revenue in the long term.

Impact: Recommended reallocating ad budget to promote Ultimate for stable revenue.

**Achievement: Data-driven strategy to optimize Megalineâ€™s profitability. ðŸ“ŠðŸ“±**
